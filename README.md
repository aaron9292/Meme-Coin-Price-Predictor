# Meme-Coin Price Predictor

**Live Prediction Dashboard for Trending Memecoins using Real-Time Sentiment and Price Data**

---

## Overview
This project is a full-stack AI-powered application that predicts the short-term price direction of trending memecoins (like $DOGE, $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, etc.) using:

- Real-time price data from CoinGecko
- Machine learning model trained on sentiment and volatility
- Live scraping of Reddit + Google News (via DuckDuckGo)
- Forecasted price chart + sentiment source evidence

It features a sleek **Streamlit UI** for displaying top memecoins, predictions, confidence scores, and underlying sentiment.

---

## Live Features
- Trending Coin Detection – via CoinGecko's trending API
- Sentiment Scraping – Reddit and DuckDuckGo news snippets
- Feature Engineering – sentiment scores, mentions, volatility
- Regression-based Price Prediction – predicts 7-day price % change
- Forecast Chart – smooth price forecast with realistic compounding
- Confidence Score – customizable buy threshold (default: 3%)
- Source Transparency – displays relevant Reddit/News posts per coin

---

## Machine Learning
- Model: Random Forest Regressor
- Target: 7-day % price change
- Labeling: Based on actual price history
- Cutoff Logic: `BUY` if predicted change > 3%, else `SKIP`
- Training Data: Automatically built from historical features
