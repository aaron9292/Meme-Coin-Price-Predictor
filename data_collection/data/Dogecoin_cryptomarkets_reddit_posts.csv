2025-02-11 16:33:10,Why Can't People Admit Solana Founders Are The Biggest Parasites In the Industry?,"Let's be honest for a second. Raj and Toly are literally the biggest parasites in the industry. They constantly shilled different tokens (jellyjelly, send, SSE, prcl, etc.) and most of these tokens, whenever the Solana founders shilled them, always get dumped to infinity.

I started suspecting that the Solana founders themselves are the main reasons why these tokens could get pumped for hours before they dumped it to infinity (and perhaps they double the profit by shorting those same tokens on hyperliquid). 

I would have never imagined it if Vitalik or other big founders shilled new tokens every week, just for the retail to get dumped over and over again. 

Don't get me wrong, I have made money too from Solana memecoins and AI agents, and admittedly I have lost money too, but the point remains, that their ""personal"" endorsements to different pump and dump coins were probably the reason why we would never have altseason, because retail will lose more and more money following the shills from the Solana founders.",102,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1in2p3u/why_cant_people_admit_solana_founders_are_the/

   Content: Just because it's new doesn't mean it's better. DeFi might have shiny tech, but at its core, it's just finance. And finance is about risk. If you don't understand the risks, you're not investing, you're gambling.

2. Post title: ""Why DeFi can't replace Traditional Finance (yet)""

   Content: Yes, DeFi has its perks, but it's crucial we don't ignore its pitfalls. Our current financial system has evolved over centuries, creating checks and balances to protect the consumer. DeFi, in its current state, lacks these safety measures.

3. Post title: ""How DeFi could be your DownFi""

   Content: High yields in DeFi? Excellent. But have you asked yourself why? If it's too good to be true, it probably is. The high yield could be a consequence of high risk. As the saying goes, ""Know what you own and why you own it.""

4. Post title: ""Unpacking DeFi Scams: An Exercise in Skeptic Analysis""

   Content: DeFi isn't immune to scams. In fact, its complex structure and lack of regulation may make it more susceptible. Always be skeptical, conduct thorough due diligence, and remember: if you can't explain it, don't invest in it.

5. Post title: ""DeFi: Innovation or Financial Russian Roulette?""

   Content: DeFi is touted as finance's next big thing. But let's be clear, it's not a magic money-making machine.

2025-02-11 00:29:14,Don’t over leverage yourself!,"I see it in this space all the time. New people or some times experienced people over leverage themselves and lose more money than they can afford.

It’s not the most popular advice to give, but if you need money for rent or for groceries don’t put it into crypto. Most of the posts about “full proof trading strategies” or “easy 100x gains on X coin” are usually scams or just flat out lies.

If you are new, don’t put in more than you can afford to lose. Look at coins with proven track records. Bitcoin isn’t the coolest crypto out there but it’s one of the safest. For example 90% of my holdings are in Bitcoin, 5% is in SOL and ETH, the rest is with projects I like or for gambling.

DCA is your best friend. Throwing everything into a coin all at once is another easy way to lose money. Don’t buy into the “ape culture”.

If something seems too good to be true it usually is. Slow organic growth is not a bad thing. Stay safe and play it smart, nobody truly knows what the market will look like tomorrow or the next day but crypto will continue to grow so don’t waste your hard earned dollars being impatient. Don’t get caught up on how much other people made off their crypto trades, most of it is luck.

3. ETH needs hype – I think it will have it. Looking back: 2017 (ICO hype), 2020 (DeFi and NFTs). We need something new to catch on so people start using ETH more, which drives the price up. (Bitcoin is a store of value; Ethereum is a utility coin – if there are no users, the price can't go up.)

A McLaren 765LT with a price tag of over a half a million USD, does it in 2.8 seconds.

When the Cheetah reaches its peak acceleration, it can only run for a few seconds more by which time, it will have expended so much energy, that it takes the poor cat over 3-days of total rest to recover from the dash. 

If it doesn't catch the Gazelle it set about to hunt, the torment of those three, or more, days will be coupled with the excruciating pain of hunger.

Yet, the Cheetah will keep going at it until a Gazelle falls victim to its speed and agility. Therefore, I don't think the thought ever occurs to the Cheetah if it will, or will not feast on the Gazelle - it simply hunts without regard for hunger, failure, or success.

I see hundreds of posters on various crypto communities commenting, and seeking advice, in a mad panic, about whether to sell their coin(s) or not because they're anxious about the ""crash"" of one coin or another, or the whole crypto market, and whatever else that bugs them. 

Maybe, said good folks, should consider if they're suited for the ""hunt"" or not!?

In other words, if you're not prepared to ache in every part of your exhausted body, and potentially go hungry for 3 or more days, maybe you should consider not hunting Gazelles!!

Why get into a boxing match with Mike Tyson if you're not prepared for the pain?

And if you decided to get in the ring for a round with Mike, why ask the crowd how or when to get out?

Therefore, when the popularity of DeepSeek began to grow, they decided to test the tool in various areas, including the crypto industry. One of the most interesting cases was presented by an investor named Nonzee. On January 28, he shared his experience of using a trading bot based on DeepSeek, which managed to turn 0.1 SOL into 52 SOL (\~$12.4 thousand) in 5 days. He chose the Pump.fun platform and was satisfied with the result.  On the social network X, he explained in detail how to set up and use this bot, emphasizing that no programming skills are required. According to him, with the help of DeepSeek, he managed to create a database of 500,000 tokens on Pump.fun. The system allows him to analyse risks, find patterns, and make transactions with high profitability.

Another case was presented by Money Tent, an investor who tested ChatGPT's capabilities for this purpose. On February 27, 2024, he decided to find out whether the chatbot could create an effective trading strategy and a bot to manage $100,000. He described the test results in his blog on Medium. However, unlike DeepSeek, ChatGPT's approach was not as successful: Money Tent noted the lack of proper risk management and an extremely low percentage of profitable transactions. He stressed that without significant refinement, this strategy cannot yet provide stable results, as losses exceed profits.

When looking at the monthly returns for bitcoin, February tends to be one of the best.

(Check it out: [https://x.com/crypto\_goos/status/1888638491904577926/photo/1](https://x.com/crypto_goos/status/1888638491904577926/photo/1))

Right now it is flashing red, which it does do sometimes, but it's not very often.

The more likely scenario is that bitcoin tends to bounce later this month and ends the month green yet again.

If we look at the 4 year cycles, it usually has a very good month during the 4th year... which is right now.

I'm really interested in hearing how you all manage the stress of trading while still maintaining a healthy and balanced life.  It seems like it's so easy to get caught up in the charts and the constant market fluctuations, and that can take a toll on your mental and emotional well-being.

So, I'm curious, what strategies do you use to keep a clear head and avoid getting overly stressed?  How do you find time for things like family, friends, hobbies, and just general relaxation?

Here are some things I'm trying to work on:

Setting clear boundaries: Like designated trading hours and no-phone zones.
Mindfulness and exercise: Trying to incorporate meditation and physical activity into my routine.
Focusing on the long term: Not getting too hung up on daily wins and losses.

2. **Meme Coin Mania:** Meme coins like PEPE are on a rollercoaster. Sure, PEPE's growing, but remember: investing in memes is like walking a tightrope over a volcano.
3. **Market Mayhem:** Just had the biggest crash since 2021 with over $1.7B in liquidations. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano all took a hit. Ouch. 
4. **China's Crypto Circus:** Despite a crackdown, China's still a big player. From blockchain projects to underground mining, they're in the game. Trump's tariffs are shaking things up even more.
5. **Regulation Roulette:** The US is trying to be crypto-friendly, but the lack of clear rules keeps things spicy. Will we ever get some solid regulations?
6. **AI to the Rescue:** AI is diving into crypto trading and security. Who knew robots could be such smart investors?

Everyone’s a critic, and everyone seems to know the facts… even when they lack any empirical evidence to back their claims. There’s a difference between making a guess, stating an opinion, and declaring something as fact. Statements like 'Altcoins are dead,' 'Crypto only has a few years left before a government bailout,' 'Sell your Altcoins,' 'Trust me,' 'Is this your first cycle?' or 'You don’t know what you’re talking about' are thrown around with such confidence. And let’s not forget the classic, 'Listen to me because I’ve been through X number of bull runs!' The narcissism is overwhelming.  

The truth is, no one knows for sure. Are there confirmed insider traders making these claims? If there were, they wouldn’t be very good at being 'insiders,' would they? So, please, let’s stop acting like we’re the ultimate authority on crypto. Arrogance is a weakness, not a strength. If you’re going to make a claim, cite your sources, and always make it clear that what you’re sharing is an opinion—not gospel. Too many people have too much at stake based on the bags they’re holding. Don’t be directly or indirectly responsible for misleading others. Stay humble.

2025-02-09 18:25:22,XRP: David or Goliath?,"Taking a broader view, XRP has shown remarkable movement over the past year. Back in November, it surged from $2 to the $3 range, eventually reaching an all-time high (ATH). With the lawsuit nearing its conclusion and a pro-crypto Trump Administration in place, there’s been a lot of optimism surrounding XRP. That said, opinions and convictions about this project vary widely. Personally, I remain a long-term believer in XRP as a project. However, given how the last few months have deviated from many people’s expectations, it’s clear that selling at ATHs in May—or even this year, as some might have hoped—is unlikely. The market remains highly volatile, and conspiracy theories are spreading faster than chlamydia on a college campus. I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this.

2025-02-09 10:37:37,Thoughts on an AI-Driven Crypto Newsletter?,"Hey everyone! 

I've been tinkering with an idea and would love to get your thoughts! I've created a newsletter that uses AI to gather crypto insights from social media buzz. The goal is to help day traders like us make better decisions.

**Here's the Scoop:**

* **AI-Powered:** The newsletter automatically pulls together trending topics and sentiments from social media.
* **Simple Strategy:** I've been testing a basic trading strategy based on the newsletter's content – going long on positively mentioned cryptos and using a trailing stop loss.
* **Results So Far:** In the past month, this approach has seen a 29% gain, while Bitcoin dropped by 5%. Pretty neat, huh?

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**

I'm curious – would something like this interest you? Would you consider paying for a newsletter that offers these kinds of insights? What else would you like to see in it to make it worth your time and money?

**Let's Discuss!**

I'm all ears and would love to hear your thoughts! Let's chat and see how we can make this newsletter even better together.

Cheers, and happy trading! ",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ilc1dp/thoughts_on_an_aidriven_crypto_newsletter/

2025-02-08 01:09:24,"Altcoin Trap ,Future Possibilities & Strategies","Looking at the history of Bitcoin, I believe we are experiencing the most difficult and unpredictable traps ever seen in Altcoins. 

Currently, I think we are experiencing the second interim rally before the bull market. Looking at previous interim rallies before bull markets: there was one before the 2017 Bull and two before the 2021 Bull. 

In the first interim rally before the 2017 and 2021 Bulls, Bitcoin saw a drop of around 50%, while Altcoins dropped by about 70%. 

In the first interim rally of 2024, Bitcoin remained strong while Altcoins dropped by about 70%, similar to what happened in previous rallies. 

Thanks to this, with the influence of ETFs, we are witnessing the strongest Bitcoin ownership in history. 

In the bear market seasons of 2026, 2027, and 2028, we may not see a Bitcoin drop of 75% like in the past. I believe there is a possibility that Bitcoin will drop by only 50%, while Altcoins may experience a 95% drop and fade away. 

Looking at the second interim rally before the 2021 Bull: In August 2020, Bitcoin corrected from $12,500 to $10,000, a 20% drop. During the months of September, October, and November 2020, while Bitcoin dropped by 20%, Altcoins dropped by 70%. 

The biggest problem is that all interim rallies until now could be predicted. 

The first interim rally before the 2021 Bull in 2019 was predictable because, historically, it was expected that the Bull would occur in 2021. 

The second interim rally before the 2021 Bull in August 2020 was predictable because, before Bitcoin's sharp rises, Altcoins were rising more than Bitcoin, indicating a rally without Bitcoin completing its rise. 

The first interim rally before the 2025 Bull in March 2024 was predictable because Altcoins began to rise before Bitcoin broke its old highs and surpassed them. Since Bitcoin had not completed its rise, it was a sign of an interim rally. I had already predicted this. 

In December 2023, I repeatedly stated that we were in an interim rally before the Bull and that Altcoins could drop by 70%, and we should not remain fully in altcoins. 

However, the second interim rally before the 2025 Bull could not have been predicted. It truly was an unexpected trap. 

Before the Altcoin Rally, everything necessary happened perfectly. Bitcoin broke its old highs and rose more than Altcoins, completing its rise. Afterward, a correction took place. Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance rose together, with Bitcoin dominance reaching a peak. The disbelief psychology before the Altcoin Rally was also created. 

A year ago, I said that if the Bull's peak were to be postponed until 2025, we could experience one more interim rally, but I did not expect a trap to be set and an interim rally to be staged before the Altcoin Rally. 

When I expected a rally in 2025, I thought that Bitcoin would not rise as it is now, reaching only around $70,000, while Altcoins would rise 5-10 times, and Bitcoin dominance would fall. Before Bitcoin completed its rise, we would experience one more interim rally, and then the Bull would come at the end of 2025. 

The current scenario, where everything happens perfectly before the Altcoin Rally, followed by an unexpected third interim rally, could not have been predicted, and if I had seen this possibility, I would have given it a very small chance. I wouldn't risk missing the Altcoin Rally for this scenario. 

We cannot say that ""since we had two interim rallies before the 2021 Bull, we will definitely have an Altcoin Rally now."" 

We must always account for the possibility of a first-time event in history, as we have been taught through experience. 

Perhaps, before the Altcoin Rally, we will have a third interim rally, and we will experience rises until May. After a 5-fold rise from this level, Altcoins might drop by 70%. If this happens, the Altcoin Rally will be postponed until the end of 2025, and we will experience another interim rally. 

If we say, ""the market will definitely remain until the end of 2025,"" and rises begin in May, we might think, ""The market always falls in May, summer is always boring and lacks volume. Let's sell in this interim rally and buy lower."" 

In this scenario, if we experience an Altcoin Rally in the summer, it would be a first in Bitcoin history. What will we do? All our efforts will be wasted. 

We must not dismiss the possibility of an Altcoin Rally happening in the summer. If the Altcoin Rally is artificially triggered in the summer, it won't stop by us saying there will be no rise in the summer. 

The darkest days in the market are when the rallies start, and in the most exuberant days of the Bull when we are all buying, Altcoins reach their peaks, and then drop by 95%, fading away. We have no influence in this market. 

In the past, when Solana was $2, everyone thought it was a scam. When Sam from FTX was told, ""You locked our Solanas and scammed us,"" he responded by saying, ""Sell me your Solanas for $3."" 

When Solana was at $2 and no one trusted it, it later skyrocketed by 100 times, reaching $200, and then people started buying and trusting it. 

When Matic was at the bottom for 2 years, everyone said it was a coin that wouldn't rise, that the owners would run away. But Matic later rose 100 times, and then people began buying and trusting it.

When Chz was at the bottom for 2 years, only Turks were buying it. Chz, which was said to never rise, later increased by 20 times in 10 days and eventually 100 times from the bottom, and then people started buying and trusting it. 

The rallies always start when we lose trust in the coins. In the Bull market, when everyone is buying and trusting, coins peak, and then they drop by 95% and fade away. 

As for my strategy:

Personally, I will not risk missing the Altcoin Rally, aiming to earn more and increase my holdings. 

When the rise starts, I won't worry about whether we are experiencing the third interim rally. I will accept the possibility of the portfolio increasing 5 times and dropping by 70%. 

If rises start in May, I won't sell, thinking, ""We are definitely postponed until the end of 2025. The market always falls in May."" I will not dismiss the possibility of the Altcoin Rally happening for the first time in the summer and wait for my targets without selling.

We are in a period of great uncertainty. Only creating a strategy will save us from this uncertainty.

If you believe in the Altcoin Rally but want to reduce risk, here is a strategy: If rises occur by May, instead of selling like me, you can sell 15-20% of your portfolio to protect it in case of a third interim rally. That way, if the Altcoin Rally starts, a small portion of your portfolio will be outside, and you won't feel uncomfortable. You can buy back when a correction comes. If a third interim rally occurs, you can increase your holdings with the portion you sold. All possibilities are on the table, and you will decide what to do.

The most important thing we must accept is that we are not the hunters in this market, but the prey. 

We must not think of ourselves as superior in the market and always be prepared for every possibility. Whatever happens, whether there is a third interim rally or not, we must be on the winning side in every scenario. If the possibility we expect happens, we should consider the possibility of being wrong, avoid extra risks, and not engage in leveraged trading. We may earn a little less, but we should always be on the winning side.

2025-02-08 19:39:38,Question about Range Trading & Wallet,"# 1) Range Trading

Most of my assets I want to keep for at least a year. But I got a bit tired watching my Cryptos go up and down constantly - and I'm guessing smo is making profits out of this...  So I am thinking to take a small portion to try out Range-Trading.

E.g. in the current phase buy BTC at 97k Sell at 102k. When at some point theres a bigger push, find a new support & resistance level and continue the scheme.

Who has experience with this and what tips can you give?

# 2) Getting a Wallet

So far I've been holding on Kraken. If I'd start range trading there I'd first sell the coins I first bought = highest taxes. So I want to put all my assets in a wallet, that ideally allows me to choose the assets based on time I bought them for trading (LIFO).

a) Which wallet?

Looking for a safe, easy to use affordable wallet. Smo recoomend Ledger Nano X Does that make sense for my use case? Other suggestions and why?

b) Where to trade cheapest

Obviously for this to work, the fees and spreads have to be good. Kraken is ok - but maybe theres a better way?

c) Safety
