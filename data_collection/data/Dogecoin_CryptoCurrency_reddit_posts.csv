2025-02-11 13:26:38,"[AMA] Giveaway with Portal to Bitcoin: Making bridges, wrapped coins, and external custody obsolete - Feb 12","Hey r/cryptocurrency!

We’re Portal to Bitcoin, the first fully custodyless, cross-chain infrastructure built for Bitcoin. Using our BitScaler architecture, we enable native-to-native asset transfers across blockchains without the security risks of bridges, wrapped assets or centralized custody.

What We’re Solving:

1. Truly decentralized cross-chain transactions with no wrapped assets, vaults or multi-sig risks
2. Fast, low-cost swaps secured by Bitcoin, the most capital-rich blockchain & what we believe to be the fundamental monetary layer
3. Seamless DeFi access with a UX rivaling CEXs and fully self-custodied
4. Sustainable liquidity incentives through a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin AMM
5. Barriers to Americans from participating in incentivization campaigns.

Who’s Here?

Our team at Portal to Bitcoin has been building on Bitcoin for a long time and is backed by Arrington Capital, Coinbase Ventures, [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) and OKX Ventures.

Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

2025-02-11 16:34:20,What's up with these tap to earn tokens ?,"
Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I’m starting to think it’s mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I’ve noticed The payouts are tiny. You’d have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won’t let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you’re just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.

1) I got two AirDrops, about 1k each, sold on the same day, on one I lost $50 and on the other I made $100 profit, how should I report them?

2) I invested example: 5k in Solana, now I have a total value of 15k in sol… I decide to sell 2k do I have to declare it anyway, even if it is less than what I invested and it is not a capital gain?

3) I have been DCA BTC for the past 3 years, small transactions of $100 a week, sold everything! 
but one of the exchanges I bought from no longer shows me how many BTC I bought and at what price…

I can declare like this: I invested 10,000, I sell for 15,000…15,000-1000=5,000 profit and I pay taxes!  Or do I always have to report the details of each individual transaction, the dates, etc.?

2025-02-11 18:22:35,"Tether transfer from abroad, taxes?","Hi there, noob in crypto here. Sorry if my English is bad sometimes. 

Tl;dr in advance: What’s the taxation on receiving about $1800 worth of tether on average monthly, from my brother in Turkey to me in the US? 

Here’s my situation and I’m trying to understand what sort of taxation I might have to deal with. 

I have assets abroad (in Turkey specifically) but I reside in the US (non-citizen, legal resident) and I want to transfer my monthly passive income that I have back there to here. It’s not much, about $1600 to $1900 each month. Using the regular bank to bank transfers I end up using about $1200 or more in a year due to horrible exchange rates and the fees. So my brother who’s a crypto enthusiast suggested that I use this method: 

I send him my Turkish Lira each month, he buys tether and transfers it to me in the US, and I transfer that into my regular bank account. So  basically a transfer from my Turkish bank account to my US bank account through a longer but supposedly cheaper way. That part seems to be accurate, but I’m wondering what my obligations are in terms of taxes. As far as chatgpt tells me, since it’s a transfer within family it can be considered a “gift”, and if it doesn’t exceed the $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion, it’ll be fine. But it does exceed the $18,000 limit. So will I be taxed on the amount after that limit, or does the whole total of transfer then gets deemed not a gift and get taxed? Also other than that, is there anything else that I need to consider?

Many thanks in advance to all who try to help. Happy gaining to you. ",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1in5e4a/tether_transfer_from_abroad_taxes/

2025-02-10 20:59:49,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

2025-02-11 18:38:33,Would this cryptocurrency idea work?,"TL;DR: Cryptocurrency with a built-in private messaging app. Messages cost one coin, and the coin is designed to be cheap due to high supply. Mining secures the network.


So I was thinking of this cryptocurrency idea but I'm not sure if it will work since no one seems to have tried to make it.


Basically, a cryptocurrency with an app that people could buy and sell the coin. Within the app, users have the ability to send messages to other users or wallet addresses using one coin as a fee per message. 


The messaging future will be decentralized and private, which is the core utility of cryptocurrency.

2025-02-10 19:19:50,"Your thoughts on the ""stable"" coin USDN","I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it’s crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it’s genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.

2025-02-11 11:26:47,"The crazy world of crypto, It's only getting worse","  
Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

XRP isn't mentioned anywhere on its website, and that got me wondering how banks even refer to XRP-based money transfers - to the extent that they acknowledge XRP or crypto to their customers at all.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different? Also, wouldn't both the sending bank AND the receiving bank need to support XRP for this sort of transfer to go through?",62,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ilueuw/can_customers_actually_do_xrpbased_money/

An actual use of cryptocurrency, yet many journalists, crypto news breakers don’t report about it. 

The government at the moment is very hot on stable coins, yet we now have the company telcoin that can now legally issue dollar backed stablecoins. They are planning for the US dollar, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, etc. the biggest remittance corridors there are, and yet we don’t spread the news? I mean, this is tech! Actual adoption and use of crypto. I just don’t get how they don’t have the CT backing or support from more people. It’s an older company that survived bear markets and is still building and it’s at its peak potential right now. And I haven even talked about telecoms, the telcoin network, and how the token is used in the systems they are soon releasing.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/0ezm6db0f9ie1.png?width=2866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ed80ca307de721aead71c5cc9a0fadedeb4a61

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it’s through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

https://preview.redd.it/ufc4f8yoa9ie1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac766257a4ac5282666da10bacf6056bb6815594

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

2025-02-11 10:38:14,Why Everything Positive You've Heard About Crypto Is a Trick,"
When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To understand why, let’s first clarify what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can provide direct benefits to people. Wheat itself stores the potential to provide that benefit. It stores value because it holds that potential. The number ""500"" is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number, the greater the potential.

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar has the potential to fulfill people's need to pay debt. Every dollar in existence enters circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars. Individuals and businesses need them, and the U.S. government needs them.

Just as biology creates the need for food, the banking system creates the need for dollars through loan contracts, collateral, and government bonds. Debtors must acquire dollars to settle the obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store the potential to satisfy that need. The dollar itself stores value because it holds the potential to provide what is needed by the debtors in the U.S. banking system. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of that potential to benefit debtors. The number '500' is simply a measure of this potential. The greater the number, the greater the potential.

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you hold a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. They store value because they hold the potential to provide benefits to people. The more units of these digital goods you hold, the more benefits you can provide.

In the above examples, we saw what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value: it means holding something with the potential to satisfy people's needs and provide a direct benefit.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. Crypto systems don’t have warehouses where they store wheat or any tangible goods. They don’t produce music, e-books, or software. They don’t issue loans, take collateral, or deal with government bonds.

What crypto systems do is assign numbers to addresses and record those assignments in a decentralized digital ledger. That’s literally it. This means that when you hold a number in your wallet, you don’t own the potential to satisfy people's needs or provide any benefit to them. All you do is hold a number.

If you hold the number 1, your potential to provide benefits to people is zero. If someone else holds the number 1,000,000, their potential is not a million times greater than yours; it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to provide benefits to people. That’s why, by holding crypto, you don't own an asset or a store of value. And you certainly don't own money or currency, since those actually store value. Simply put, you hold a number but own nothing.

Crypto holders, recognizing they own nothing, resort to spreading false or misleading narratives in a desperate bid to offload their numbers and acquire assets. One such false narrative is about scarcity. For instance, they point to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap and call it scarcity. But scarcity applies to things that satisfy needs or provide benefits. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is nothing that can satisfy people's needs; there's nothing to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of numbers assigned to addresses.

An example of a misleading narrative is the supposed simplicity and speed of crypto. This is often touted as one of its appealing qualities, but the reality is that crypto is fast and easy precisely because it doesn't manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Take wheat, for example: it requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars, too, involve a complex web of processes, from assessing creditworthiness to drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because managing something that actually provides benefits to people is far from simple or easy.

In contrast, crypto systems only track which number is assigned to which address. And tracking numbers? That’s straightforward and easy.

Another false narrative is that value is belief-based, that something is valuable if people believe in it, and if they don't, it's not valuable. But belief cannot change the potential of something to satisfy people’s needs. Wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition, and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks, regardless of what anyone believes. That stored potential is value. The claim that value is based on belief is just another trick crypto holders use to mislead people into giving up assets in exchange for numbers.

No matter how many narratives crypto advocates spin, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Everything positive you’ve ever heard about crypto is just a trick to get ownership of your valuable assets and dump numbers on you.",0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1imvpx5/why_everything_positive_youve_heard_about_crypto/

2025-02-11 06:11:31,I regret not buying Solana in 2020,"I’m currently fixated on the fact that I didn’t invest in Solana in 2020 when it first released. I had $20,000 to my name at the time. I could’ve put $10,000 into Solana and made $2,000,000+. I hate that I’m getting into crypto now. I should have a long time ago. I no longer have that kind of money. I hate having to go to school and get a 9-5. I’m dealing with mental illness so everything is difficult.

I’m currently unemployed, depressed and hopeless. Living with my mom at 28. I don’t mean to sound like this, I just I’m really struggling to accept the fact that it never happened. And it may never happen in my life. 

I currently fantasize of what I would do with all the money. How my quality of life would be 10x better than what it is today. If only I would’ve know. And yet, I don’t know a single person who invested in Solana that early and is a multimillionaire. It’s a terrible intrusive thought that won’t leave me. 

But can someone please help me get over this thought and move forward with my life? It really is impacting so negatively. How do I get over this obsessive thought? It’s really ruining my quality of life 24/7. ",0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ims3p6/i_regret_not_buying_solana_in_2020/

But apparently he doesn't see an issue with 20-25% of supply (lost wallets) being taken by quantum computing.  

That's quite the rosy take on it.  I'd imagine smart money would exit ahead of this for 3 reasons.    
  
Potential panic as wallets ""wake up"" at an alarming rate.    
Potential panic at what the price impact could be.    
Potential panic of people worrying others will panic.

  
I actually think there is a much better approach - that I've written about before.    
  
I was told it was a bad idea.  My guess is people either didn't get it, or didn't like the idea that quantum computing requires solutions, starting now to properly be ready without disruption.

This certainly is not a narrative, it isn't FUD.    
  
The biggest players in the world recognize it- and that includes the CEO of Tether.

2025-02-10 10:55:12,I have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102,"Hey,

I've been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff, and I just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that I want an answer for, but before my question I just want to link this from the wikipedia:

**""Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $487 in 2023) per troy ounce.""**

What if, US government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices, that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind? Can't they make another executive order for let's say Microstrategy, that either all their shares, or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the US government, either for free, or for some fee such as the current market price.

I understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings, especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut, but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their BTC holdings, what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like MSTR to forfeit all the bitcoin to the US government?

I'm not the best at explaining and asking stuff, but I hope you guys understand where I'm going with this, like don't people like michael saylor or companies such as MSTR with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin, since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end? I'm a firm believer of self-custody and I had this question for the people that own MSTR stock, like ""what if? not your keys not your coins, right?""

2025-02-09 13:37:41,I made an Open source tool to help you backtest your trading or investment strategy,"Backtesting a strategy means applying it to a historical dataset and seeing how it would have performed on past data. The results should then determine if this is a potentially viable strategy to start live trading/investing with, or whether it needs some more fine-tuning.

The problem with backtesting strategies is that it usually requires you to pretty much re-write your backtesting algorithm because each strategy needs to be configured to act in a specific way. To get around this issue, I made a simple tool that allows you to easily create plug-and-play strategies and slot them into the Backtester.

The tool is written in Python and uses the Backtester py library to handle backtesting and reporting. Because it's modular it's very easy to code a strategy and test it. For instance, here's how you'd go about coding a Buy The Dip strategy:

    class BuyTheDip(Strategy):
        def init(self):
            pass
    
        def next(self):
            current_close = self.data.Close[-1]  # Current candle's close
            previous_close = self.data.Close[-2]  # Previous candle's close
            price_difference = (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * 100
    
            if price_difference <= -5:
                self.buy(
                    size=0.1, sl=stop_loss * current_close, tp=take_profit * current_close
                )
                print(
                    f""Bought at {current_close}, which is a {price_difference}% from previous close ({previous_close})""
                )
            else:
                print(f""Did not buy, price difference is only {price_difference}%"")

Here, we want to buy Bitcoin every time the price drops by more than 5% compared to the previous candle close.  
Running the strategy will output its performance like so:

Buy and Hold Return%, Return %, Win Rate and Profit Factor are metrics you need to look out for. 

* Buy and Hold return tells us whether it's more advantageous to simply buy and hold rather than trade over that specific period
* Return % is the amount of profit made trading
* Win Rate is a percentage showing how many of our trades are profitable. As you can see buying dips and selling them at a 5% take profit gives us a 90% profitability rate.
* Profit Factor represents the gross profit divided by the gross loss

The backtester will also plot the performance, showing you the entry and exit positions on a candlestick chart.

In my example, I used CoinGecko API to fetch historical data, but you may use any data source you wish, as long as you feed it candlestick data.
